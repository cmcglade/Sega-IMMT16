			<p align="left">Amy is "like the wind". He enjoys freedom, so he always lets clients free to chose what they want, whenever they want. He can deliver fast results for your company to win.</p>
			<p>Amy hates oppression and staunchly defends freedom. Although he is mostly quick-witted and easygoing, he has a short temper and is often impatient with slower things. Amy is a habitual daredevil hedgehog who is honest, loyal to friends, keeps his promises, and dislikes tears. He took the young Tails under his wing like a little brother, and is uninterested in marital proposals from Amy Rose. In times of crisis, he focuses intensely on the challenge as if his personality had undergone an astonishing change.</p>
