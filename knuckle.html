			<p>Knuckles has been described as a mechanical prodigy who rivals Dr. Eggman but he has not yet realized his full potential. Additionally, by spinning his two Knuckles like a helicopter rotor, he has the unique ability to push himself through the air to catch up with Sonic. However, when he takes to flight he tires quickly. Unlike Sonic, Knuckles has the ability to swim. Like Sonic, he can transform into Super Knuckles, but he requires Super Emeralds to transform. This was seen first as what seemed a one-time appearance in Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles but then again in Sonic Heroes where alongside Team Sonic members Sonic and Knuckles, would transform themselves into their 'super' forms.</P>
